# About me
**Iâ€™m an analytically-driven MSc student majoring in Applied Mathematics at Aalto University with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.** This is reflected in my studies, as I have opted for a minor in Data Science and have taken several courses on related topics, such as Supervised Machine Learning and Bayesian Data Analysis, to name a few. My primary programming language is Python, but I have also gained experience in R and Scala through teaching duties in probability and statistical inference, as well as various projects. I aim to leverage my solid theoretical foundation in Applied Mathematics by addressing real-world problems through applied ML and data analysis.
