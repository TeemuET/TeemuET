# About me
**Iâ€™m an analytically-driven MSc student majoring in Applied Mathematics at Aalto University with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.** This is reflected in my studies, as I have opted for a minor in Data Science and have taken several courses on related topics, such as Supervised Machine Learning and Bayesian Data Analysis, to name a few. My primary programming language is Python, but I have also gained experience in R and Scala through teaching duties in probability and statistical inference, as well as various projects. I aim to leverage my solid theoretical foundation in Applied Mathematics by addressing real-world problems through applied ML and data analysis.

In this thesis I primarily utilized <code>GPyTorch</code> along with a High-Performance Computing cluster ([Triton](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/)) for large-scale data processing and parallel computing.

# Sustainable Finance in the Quantum Era Hackathon
I was a part of a winning team at the Ultrahack hackathon in the fall of 2024. In about 36 hours, I and my 4 teammates were able to formulate a sound business idea and excecute a technical implementation behind the concept. Our solution was a portfolio optimization and prediction platform intended to be integrated into a stock broker's website. We implemented both a classical optimization algorithm and one with Quantum Computing based on a recent [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45392-w). We also implemented a geometric brownian motion based prediction tool using the monte carlo method and incorporated impact data and ESG scoring from [The Upright Project](https://www.uprightproject.com/). My main area of responsibility was on the technical implementation and the implementing the research article in practice. The project and the pitch slides can be found from my teammates github below:

Above are the programming languages and documentation tools I'm used to working with in order of proficiency.

Most of my experience with <code>GPyTorch</code> and <code>PyTorch</code> has been gathered at the Complex Systems and Materials group within the Department of Applied Physics at Aalto University. I researched the use of Machine Learning in Atom Probe Tomography data reconstruction. Unfortunately, I cannot publish the source code for the project yet as this work, where I serve as the lead author, is culminating in a research paper that is currently in progress.

In addition to this experience, I have done Data Analysis and Machine Learning during various school projects. Most of these projects have not been uploaded to Git which is a work in progress.
